# PV3 Business Model & Unit Economics

> **Disclaimer:** All financial projections are illustrative models based on comparable gaming platforms and reasonable assumptions. Actual results will depend on user adoption, market conditions, competition, execution, and numerous other factors. These projections are not guarantees of future performance.

## Revenue Model

### Primary Revenue Stream: Platform Fees

**Match Fees (6% of every wager):**
- Treasury: 5%
- Referral Pool: 1%

**Example:**
```
Match: 2 players x 1 SOL wager = 2 SOL pot
Platform fee: 0.12 SOL (6%)
Winner receives: 1.88 SOL (94%)
Treasury: 0.10 SOL (5%)
Referral pool: 0.02 SOL (1%)
```

### Secondary Revenue Streams:

**1. Withdrawal Fees**
- Standard: 0.5% (no 2FA)
- Discounted: 0.1% (with 2FA enabled)
- Encourages security while generating revenue

**2. Cross-Chain Bridge Fees**
- 0.5% on ETH/BSC/Polygon → Solana deposits
- Wormhole network fees passed through
- Growing revenue as we expand payment options

**3. Tournament Fees**
- 10-15% tournament entry fee
- Higher margin due to increased engagement value
- Sponsorship opportunities at scale

**4. Developer Revenue Share (Future)**
- 50% of fees from third-party games
- Platform keeps 50%
- Scales as developer ecosystem grows
