## Token Strategy

### Current Status: No Token

**Philosophy:** Build the product and user base first. Token later.

**Why No Token Yet:**

1. **Product-First Approach:**
   - Need real users and traction first
   - Token without users = speculative asset
   - Focus on building sustainable business

2. **Regulatory Clarity:**
   - Wait for clearer regulations
   - Launch when we can do it properly
   - Avoid legal complications early on

3. **User Base Required:**
   - Need 50K-100K active users minimum
   - Token should reward existing community
   - Not a fundraising gimmick

### Future Token Plans

**Timeline:** Post-traction (Year 1-2)

**When We'll Launch Token:**
- 100K+ active users
- $100M+ transaction volume

## The Vision

**PV3 is more than a gaming platform. It's the cloud gaming infrastructure layer for Web3.**

I'm not building this to flip it in 6 months. I'm building this to become the dominant gaming platform in Web3 over the next 5-10 years.

**The mission:** Make blockchain gaming feel like Web2 gaming, but with earning potential. Onboard the next 10 million Web2 gamers to Web3.

**The positioning:**
- **Not "Web3 Steam"** - Steam requires downloads and installs
- **We're Xbox Cloud Gaming + Web3 earning** - Instant access, play anywhere, earn everywhere
- **Cloud gaming meets blockchain** - Browser-based AAA quality with real money stakes

**The goal:** Become the platform where gamers earn, developers build, and creators grow. The instant-access gaming platform of Web3.

**The commitment:** Whatever it takes. This is my life's work.
