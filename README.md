# PV3: The Web Gaming Layer of Solana

**Player vs Player** - Bringing provably fair gaming to the masses on Solana.

---

## We're Building the Future of On-Chain Gaming

The gaming industry is broken. Centralized platforms control everything - your money, your data, your winnings. You deposit funds and just *hope* the house isn't rigging the game. There's zero transparency, zero proof, and zero trust.

**We're fixing that.**

PV3 isn't just another gaming dapp. We're building the foundational **Web Gaming Layer** for Solana - where every game is provably fair, every transaction is instant, and players actually own their experience.

## What Makes PV3 Different

### ‚ö° True Gas-Free Gaming: Session Vault System

This is our killer feature. Nobody wants to approve 50 wallet transactions during a gaming session.

Our **Session Vault** architecture lets you deposit once (0.02 SOL minimum), then play unlimited games without touching your wallet again. All transactions happen on-chain but users don't see any of it. It just works.

**How it works:**
- Deposit once into your session vault
- Play any number of games - no wallet popups, no transaction approvals, no friction
- Infrastructure fees (0.0035 SOL create / 0.0015 SOL join) automatically managed
- Winnings instantly credited to your vault
- Withdraw anytime with micro fees (0.1% with 2FA, 0.5% without)

This is **true Web2 UX on Web3 rails**. Players forget they're using blockchain - and that's the point.

### üîê Cryptographically Verifiable Results

We're not just "trust us it's fair" - we use **Ed25519 signature verification on-chain** to cryptographically prove every game outcome before releasing funds.

Here's how it works:
1. Game ends ‚Üí Backend validates game rules
2. Backend creates result hash (SHA-256)
3. Backend signs with Ed25519 private key
4. Smart contract verifies signature on Solana before payout
5. Funds only release if cryptographic proof is valid

Every player can independently verify their match results. No trust required - just math.

### üéÆ 10 Production-Ready Games

We didn't build one game - we built a gaming platform. Currently live:

**Turn-Based:**
- Chess (with full move validation and time controls)
- Coinflip (best-of-5 with 3D physics animations)
- Rock Paper Scissors (3D hand animations, anti-cheat)

**Quick Decision:**
- Dice Duel (RPG-style dice rolls)
- Mines (Minesweeper-style board game)
- Crash (real-time multiplier betting)
- Hi-Lo (card prediction game)
- High Card Duel (highest card wins)

**Strategy:**
- Math Duel (solve math problems, first to 3 wins)
- Reaction Ring (click reaction time game)

Every game uses the same contract, same session vault system, same instant payouts, same cryptographic verification.

### üí∞ Fair Economics

- **6% platform fee** (5% treasury + 1% referral pool)
- **0.1-10 SOL wager range** - accessible to everyone
- **Winner takes 94%** of the pot
- **Infrastructure fees** baked in so users never think about gas
- **Escrow protection** - all wagers held in program-controlled accounts until verified

## Why Solana?

Simple: **speed and cost**.

- Sub-second match settlement
- Transaction costs under $0.001
- 65k TPS capacity for massive scale
- Best gaming dev tooling (Anchor, Web3.js)
- Fastest growing gaming ecosystem in crypto

We're not building for a future where Solana is fast. It's already the fastest. We're building for a future where **millions of people play games on Solana every day** and don't even realize they're using blockchain.

## The Vision: Gaming Infrastructure for Solana

We see PV3 as the **foundational gaming layer** that other developers will build on.

Our session vault system? Other dapps will integrate it for gas-free UX.
Our cryptographic verification? Industry standard for fairness.
Our game contracts? Open-source templates for builders.

PV3 isn't just a product - it's **infrastructure** for a new gaming economy on Solana where:
- **Players** get provably fair games and actually own their winnings
- **Developers** can build games on our rails without reinventing the wheel
- **The ecosystem** grows because gaming brings millions of users to Solana

We're not competing with existing gaming dapps. **We're building the rails they'll all run on.**

## What Makes This Special

Most "provably fair" platforms just use Solana's blockchain transparency. That's table stakes.

**We went further:**
- Cryptographic proof of every result (Ed25519 signatures)
- Gas-free gaming experience (session vaults)
- True Web2 UX on Web3 rails
- Production-grade anti-cheat and security
- Complete gaming ecosystem (streaming, social, analytics)

This isn't a casino. This isn't a single game. **This is the gaming layer of Solana.**

## Join the Revolution

**For Investors:**
We're building infrastructure, not a dapp. Every game on Solana could run on PV3 rails.

**For Players:**
Every game is provably fair. Every win is instant. Your money is always yours.

**For Builders:**
Our contracts and architecture will be open source. Build on PV3 infrastructure.
