```

**Lifetime Earnings:**
```
Referrer with 100 active users (Tier 4):
Average per user: 2 SOL fees/month
Referrer earnings: 50 SOL/month (25% of 200 SOL)

## User Economics

### Player Profitability

**House Edge: 3%**
```
Platform takes 6% of total pot
Players split remaining 94%
Effective house edge per player: 3%

Better than most casinos (5-15% house edge)
```

**Break-Even Win Rate:**
```
To break even after platform fees:
Required win rate: 53%
Actual fair odds: 50%
Skill advantage needed: 3%

This is achievable for good players
```

**Expected Value (EV):**
```
Scenario 1: 50% win rate (coin flip)
Expected Loss: -3% per game
$100 bet → Expected return: $97

Scenario 2: 55% win rate (skilled player)
Expected Profit: +2% per game
$100 bet → Expected return: $102

Scenario 3: 60% win rate (pro player)
Expected Profit: +7% per game
$100 bet → Expected return: $107
```

### Whale Economics

**High-Stakes Players:**
```
Max Wager: 10 SOL per game
Max Win: 18.8 SOL (94% of 20 SOL pot)
Max Profit: 8.8 SOL per game

100 games/day @ 10 SOL:
Volume: 1,000 SOL wagered
Fees Paid: 60 SOL (6%)
Net (at 55% WR): +40 SOL/day

Daily profit potential: +40 SOL ($4,000 at $100/SOL)
Monthly potential: +1,200 SOL ($120,000 at $100/SOL)
```

**VIP Program (Future):**
```
Volume Tier 1 (>100 SOL/day): 5.5% fee (0.5% discount)
Volume Tier 2 (>1,000 SOL/day): 5% fee (1% discount)
Volume Tier 3 (>10,000 SOL/day): 4.5% fee (1.5% discount)

Incentivizes high-volume play
Sustainable for platform
Competitive with traditional casinos

## Token Economics (Future Considerations)

### PV3 Token (Potential)

**Use Cases:**
```
1. Governance
   - Vote on new games
   - Vote on fee changes
   - Vote on feature priorities

2. Staking Rewards
   - Stake tokens → Reduced fees
   - Stake tokens → Revenue share
   - Stake tokens → Early access

3. In-Game Utility
   - Tournament entry tokens
   - Premium feature access
   - NFT purchases
   - Profile customization
```

**Token Distribution (Hypothetical):**
```
Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 PV3
├── 30% Team & Advisors (4-year vest)
├── 20% Early Investors (2-year vest)
├── 25% Community Rewards (5-year emission)
├── 15% Treasury & Development
└── 10% Liquidity & Market Making
```

**Emission Schedule (Hypothetical):**
```
Year 1: 10% of community allocation
Year 2: 20% of community allocation
Year 3: 25% of community allocation
Year 4: 25% of community allocation
Year 5: 20% of community allocation
```

**Note:** Token launch is post-MVP, post-PMF (product-market fit). Focus is on platform revenue first, token economics second.

## Risk Mitigation

### Economic Risks

**SOL Price Volatility:**
```
Mitigation:
- Fees denominated in SOL (scales with price)
- Costs mostly fixed in USD (servers, labor)
- Higher SOL price = Higher absolute revenue
- Lower SOL price = Same % margins
```

**User Acquisition Costs:**
```
Mitigation:
- Referral program (organic growth)
- Content marketing (low CAC)
- Viral features (session vaults, fair gaming)
- Target LTV/CAC ratio: 10:1
```

**Competition:**
```
Mitigation:
- Session vault system (2-year moat)
- Ed25519 verification (technical advantage)
- First-mover on Solana gaming
- Network effects (more users = more matches)
```

### Regulatory Risks

**Gaming Regulations:**
```
Mitigation:
- Skill-based games (not pure gambling)
- KYC/AML compliance ready
- Age verification systems
- Jurisdiction-based restrictions
- Legal counsel on retainer
```
