### Why This Works

**Compounding Network Effects:**
- Your referrals play forever
- As they play more, you earn more
- Platform grows = higher volume per user
- New games launch = more engagement
- Tournaments = usage spikes

**Example Compounding:**
```
Month 1:  10 referrals √ó $500 = $5,000 volume ‚Üí $30 earned
Month 3:  25 referrals √ó $750 = $18,750 volume ‚Üí $112 earned
Month 6:  50 referrals √ó $1,000 = $50,000 volume ‚Üí $600 earned
Month 12: 100 referrals √ó $1,500 = $150,000 volume ‚Üí $2,250 earned
Month 24: 300 referrals √ó $2,000 = $600,000 volume ‚Üí $9,000 earned

Your referrals wager MORE over time as they:
- Get better at games (higher stakes)
- Join tournaments (higher volume)
- Invite friends (social multiplier)
- Become regulars (habit formation)
```
