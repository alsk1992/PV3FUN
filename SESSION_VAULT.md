# Session Vault System: The UX Revolution

## The Problem We Solved

Traditional blockchain gaming sucks for users:

```
User wants to play 10 games:
❌ Approve wallet transaction (game 1)
❌ Sign transaction (game 1)
❌ Wait for confirmation...
❌ Approve wallet transaction (game 2)
❌ Sign transaction (game 2)
❌ Wait for confirmation...
❌ Approve wallet transaction (game 3)
... repeat 10 times ...

Result: User rage quits after game 3
```

**With PV3 Session Vaults:**

```
User wants to play 10 games:
✅ Deposit 1 SOL once
✅ Play 10 games (no wallet interaction)
✅ Withdraw whenever

Result: Seamless Web2-style experience
```

---

## How It Works

### 1. Vault Creation

**User Journey:**
```
1. User clicks "Create Session Vault"
2. One-time wallet approval (0.02 SOL minimum)
3. Smart contract creates PDA vault owned by user
4. User can now play unlimited games
```

**Smart Contract Logic:**
```rust
pub fn create_session_vault(
    ctx: Context<CreateSessionVault>,
    infrastructure_prepayment: u64
) -> Result<()> {
    // User pays 0.02 SOL infrastructure credit
    // Vault created with PDA: [b"session_vault", user_pubkey]

    let vault = &mut ctx.accounts.session_vault;
    vault.owner = ctx.accounts.user.key();
    vault.balance = 0;
    vault.infrastructure_credit = infrastructure_prepayment;
    vault.games_played = 0;
    vault.created_at = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;

    Ok(())
}
```

**Backend Option (Seamless Onboarding):**
```rust
// Backend can create vault for user (paid by platform)
// Cost recovered silently from user's first deposit
pub fn create_session_vault_for_user(...) -> Result<()> {
    vault.creation_cost_recovered = false; // Mark for recovery
}
```

---

### 2. Deposit Flow

**User Journey:**
```
1. User clicks "Deposit 5 SOL"
2. One wallet approval
3. Funds instantly available for gaming
4. Smart contract manages everything
```

**Smart Contract Logic:**
```rust
pub fn deposit_to_session(
    ctx: Context<DepositToSession>,
    amount: u64
) -> Result<()> {
    let vault = &mut ctx.accounts.session_vault_account;

    // Auto-refill infrastructure credit if low
    let mut infrastructure_topup = 0;
    if vault.infrastructure_credit < 0.01 SOL {
        infrastructure_topup = 0.03 SOL; // Refill 30ms worth
    }

    let total_transfer = amount + infrastructure_topup;

    // Transfer from user wallet to vault PDA
    transfer(
        ctx.accounts.user,
        ctx.accounts.session_vault,
        total_transfer
    )?;

    // Update vault balances
    vault.balance += amount;
    vault.infrastructure_credit += infrastructure_topup;

    // Silent cost recovery if vault was created by backend
    if !vault.creation_cost_recovered && vault.balance >= 0.02 SOL {
        vault.balance -= 0.02 SOL; // Recover platform's vault creation cost
        vault.creation_cost_recovered = true;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Auto-refills infrastructure credit when low
- ✅ Silent cost recovery (user doesn't notice)
- ✅ Full deposit amount shown to user
- ✅ All fees managed transparently

---

### 3. Gas-Free Gaming

**Match Creation (from Session Vault):**
```rust
pub fn create_match_with_session_vault(
    ctx: Context<CreateMatchWithSessionVault>,
    game_type: GameType,
    wager_amount: u64,
    expiry_time: i64,
    timestamp: i64,
) -> Result<()> {
    let vault = &mut ctx.accounts.session_vault_account;

    // 1. Deduct infrastructure fee (0.0035 SOL)
    deduct_infrastructure_fee(vault, 0.0035 SOL, 0.01 SOL)?;

    // 2. Check vault has sufficient balance
    require!(vault.balance >= wager_amount, InsufficientFunds);

    // 3. Transfer wager from vault to match escrow
    **ctx.accounts.session_vault.lamports() -= wager_amount;
    **ctx.accounts.match_escrow.lamports() += wager_amount;
    vault.balance -= wager_amount;
    vault.games_played += 1;

    // 4. Create match account
    let match_account = &mut ctx.accounts.match_account;
    match_account.creator = ctx.accounts.user.key();
    match_account.wager_amount = wager_amount;
    match_account.game_type = game_type;
    match_account.status = MatchStatus::WaitingForPlayer;

    Ok(())
}
```

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Click "Create Match" button
- ✅ NO wallet popup
- ✅ NO transaction approval
- ✅ Match instantly created
- ✅ Wager automatically deducted from vault

---

### 4. Instant Winnings Credit

**Result Submission:**
```rust
pub fn submit_result(...) -> Result<()> {
    // After Ed25519 verification passes...

    let winner_amount = total_pot * 0.94; // Winner gets 94%
    let platform_fee = total_pot * 0.06;  // Platform gets 6%

    // Priority: Credit to session vault (if exists)
    if let Some(winner_vault) = ctx.accounts.winner_session_vault {
        **ctx.accounts.match_escrow.lamports() -= winner_amount;
        **winner_vault.lamports() += winner_amount;
        winner_vault.balance += winner_amount; // Update tracked balance
    } else {
        // Fallback: Direct to winner's wallet
        **ctx.accounts.match_escrow.lamports() -= winner_amount;
        **ctx.accounts.winner.lamports() += winner_amount;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Match ends
- ✅ Result verified cryptographically
- ✅ Winnings instantly in vault
- ✅ NO wallet interaction
- ✅ Ready to play next game immediately

### 5. Withdrawal Flow

**User Journey:**
```
1. User clicks "Withdraw 3 SOL"
2. Choose 2FA (0.1% fee) or no 2FA (0.5% fee)
3. One wallet approval
4. Funds instantly in wallet
```

**Smart Contract Logic:**
```rust
pub fn withdraw_from_session(
    ctx: Context<WithdrawFromSession>,
    amount: u64
) -> Result<()> {
    let vault = &mut ctx.accounts.session_vault_account;

    require!(vault.balance >= amount, InsufficientFunds);

    // Fee calculation
    let has_2fa = ctx.accounts.user.has_2fa_enabled; // From account data
    let fee_bps = if has_2fa { 10 } else { 50 }; // 0.1% or 0.5%
    let withdrawal_fee = (amount * fee_bps) / 10000;
    let withdrawal_amount = amount - withdrawal_fee;

    // Transfer from vault PDA to user wallet
    **ctx.accounts.session_vault.lamports() -= amount;
    **ctx.accounts.user.lamports() += withdrawal_amount;
    **ctx.accounts.treasury.lamports() += withdrawal_fee;

    vault.balance -= amount;

    Ok(())
}
```

**Fee Structure:**
- With 2FA: 0.1% fee (secure)
- Without 2FA: 0.5% fee (incentivizes security)
- Fees go to treasury (platform sustainability)

## Infrastructure Fee Management

### Auto-Refill System

**Problem:** Users shouldn't worry about infrastructure fees

**Solution:** Automatic credit management

```rust
fn deduct_infrastructure_fee(
    vault: &mut SessionVault,
    fee_amount: u64,
    refill_amount: u64
) -> Result<()> {
    // Deduct fee from infrastructure credit
    require!(
        vault.infrastructure_credit >= fee_amount,
        InsufficientInfrastructure
    );

    vault.infrastructure_credit -= fee_amount;

    // Auto-refill if getting low
    let min_credit = 0.01 SOL; // ~3 games worth
    if vault.infrastructure_credit < min_credit {
        // Will be topped up from next deposit automatically
        emit!(InfrastructureRefillNeeded {
            user: vault.owner,
            current_credit: vault.infrastructure_credit,
        });
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

**Fee Breakdown:**
- Match creation: 0.0035 SOL (~1/3 of a penny)
- Match join: 0.0015 SOL (~1/6 of a penny)
- Initial credit: 0.02 SOL (covers ~6 games)
- Auto-refill: 0.03 SOL (covers ~9 games)

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Deposit once
- ✅ Infrastructure credit auto-managed
- ✅ Never runs out during gameplay
- ✅ Silently topped up from deposits

## Economic Model

### Platform Sustainability

**Revenue per Game:**
```
Wager: 1 SOL (each player)
Total Pot: 2 SOL
Platform Fee (6%): 0.12 SOL
  ├─ Treasury (5%): 0.10 SOL
  └─ Referral Pool (1%): 0.02 SOL
Winner Receives (94%): 1.88 SOL
```

**Infrastructure Costs per Game:**
```
Create match: 0.0035 SOL
Join match: 0.0015 SOL
Solana fees: ~0.0001 SOL
Total cost: ~0.005 SOL
```

**Profit Margin:**
```
Revenue: 0.12 SOL (6% of 2 SOL)
Costs: 0.005 SOL
Profit: 0.115 SOL per game
Margin: 95.8%
```

**At Scale (10,000 games/day):**
```
Daily Revenue: 1,200 SOL
Daily Costs: 50 SOL
Daily Profit: 1,150 SOL
```

### User Economics

**Break-Even Analysis:**
```
Initial Deposit: 1 SOL
Infrastructure: 0.02 SOL (one-time)
Games Played: 20 games @ 0.05 SOL each
Total Wagered: 1 SOL
Win Rate Needed: 53% (to break even after 6% platform fee)

With 50% skill:
Expected Loss: 6% of wagered amount = 0.06 SOL per SOL wagered
House Edge: 3% (lower than most casinos)
```

**Whale-Friendly:**
```
Max Wager: 10 SOL
Max Win (94%): 18.8 SOL per game
No withdrawal limits
Instant withdrawals (0.1-0.5% fee)
```

## Technical Implementation

### PDA Structure

```rust
#[account]
pub struct SessionVault {
    pub owner: Pubkey,                    // 32 bytes - User's wallet
    pub balance: u64,                     // 8 bytes - Available gaming balance
    pub infrastructure_credit: u64,       // 8 bytes - Pre-paid infrastructure fees
    pub games_played: u64,                // 8 bytes - Total games counter
    pub created_at: i64,                  // 8 bytes - Unix timestamp
    pub creation_cost_recovered: bool,    // 1 byte - Backend cost recovery flag
    pub bump: u8,                         // 1 byte - PDA bump seed
}
// Total: 66 bytes

Seeds: [b"session_vault", owner.key().as_ref()]
```

### State Transitions

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Vault Created  │ (balance = 0, infrastructure = 0.02)
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         │ deposit(5 SOL)
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Vault Funded    │ (balance = 5, infrastructure = 0.02)
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         │ create_match(1 SOL)
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Match Active    │ (balance = 4, escrow = 1, infrastructure = 0.0165)
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         │ win_match
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Winnings Credited│ (balance = 5.88, infrastructure = 0.0165)
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         │ withdraw(2 SOL)
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Partial Balance │ (balance = 3.88, infrastructure = 0.0165)
└─────────────────┘
```

## Security Considerations

### Vault Protection

**Access Control:**
```rust
// Only vault owner can withdraw
require!(
    ctx.accounts.user.key() == vault.owner,
    Unauthorized
);

// Only platform verifier can credit winnings
require!(
    ctx.accounts.verifier.key() == config.verifier_pubkey,
    UnauthorizedVerifier
);
```

**Balance Validation:**
```rust
// Always check balance before operations
require!(
    vault.balance >= amount,
    InsufficientFunds
);

// Infrastructure credit must cover fees
require!(
    vault.infrastructure_credit >= fee_amount,
    InsufficientInfrastructure
);
```

**Reentrancy Protection:**
```rust
// All state changes BEFORE external calls
vault.balance -= amount;              // 1. Update state
**vault_pda.lamports() -= amount;     // 2. Then transfer
**user_wallet.lamports() += amount;   // 3. Never the reverse
```

### Anti-Drain Measures

**Withdrawal Rate Limiting:**
- Max 1 withdrawal per minute (backend enforced)
- Suspicious patterns flagged
- Large withdrawals (>10 SOL) require 2FA

**Balance Reconciliation:**
- Backend tracks vault balance
- Daily audit against on-chain state
- Discrepancies investigated immediately
