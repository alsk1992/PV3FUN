# Session Vault Infrastructure: Gas-Free Transaction Layer

## The Problem We Solved

Traditional blockchain gaming sucks for users:

```
User wants to play 10 games:
❌ Approve wallet transaction (game 1)
❌ Sign transaction (game 1)
❌ Wait for confirmation...
❌ Approve wallet transaction (game 2)
❌ Sign transaction (game 2)
❌ Wait for confirmation...
❌ Approve wallet transaction (game 3)
... repeat 10 times ...

Result: User rage quits after game 3
```

**With PV3 Session Vaults:**

```
User wants to play 10 games:
✅ Deposit 1 SOL once
✅ Play 10 games (no wallet interaction)
✅ Withdraw whenever

Result: Seamless Web2-style experience
```

---

## How It Works

### 1. Vault Creation

**User Journey:**
```
1. User clicks "Create Session Vault"
2. One-time wallet approval (0.02 SOL minimum)
3. Smart contract creates PDA vault owned by user
4. User can now play unlimited games
```

**Smart Contract Logic:**
```
Program-derived address initialization
Owner authority binding with cryptographic verification
Zero-balance initialization with infrastructure pre-funding
Usage counter initialization
Timestamp-based audit trail creation
```

**Backend-Initiated Creation (Seamless Onboarding):**
```
Platform subsidizes initial vault creation cost
Cost recovery flag set for transparent amortization
User experiences zero-friction onboarding
Silent cost recovery on first deposit
```

---

### 2. Deposit Flow

**User Journey:**
```
1. User clicks "Deposit 5 SOL"
2. One wallet approval
3. Funds instantly available for gaming
4. Smart contract manages everything
```

**Smart Contract Logic:**
```
Vault account retrieval and validation
Infrastructure credit threshold evaluation
Conditional automatic top-up calculation
Atomic transfer from user to PDA vault
Balance updates with consistency guarantees
Transparent cost recovery protocol execution
State machine update with audit trail
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Auto-refills infrastructure credit when low
- ✅ Silent cost recovery (user doesn't notice)
- ✅ Full deposit amount shown to user
- ✅ All fees managed transparently

---

### 3. Gas-Free Gaming

**Match Creation (from Session Vault):**
```
Step 1: Infrastructure fee deduction with threshold validation
Step 2: Balance sufficiency verification with atomic check
Step 3: Cross-program invocation for escrow transfer
Step 4: Vault balance update with consistency guarantee
Step 5: Usage metric increment for analytics
Step 6: Match account initialization with state machine setup
Step 7: Return success with transaction finality
```

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Click "Create Match" button
- ✅ NO wallet popup
- ✅ NO transaction approval
- ✅ Match instantly created
- ✅ Wager automatically deducted from vault

### 4. Instant Winnings Credit

**Result Submission:**
```
Ed25519 signature verification completes successfully
Fee distribution calculation (94% winner, 6% platform)
Priority settlement path evaluation
    If session vault exists:
        Atomic escrow → vault transfer
        Tracked balance update for consistency
    Else fallback path:
        Direct escrow → winner wallet transfer
Platform fee distribution to treasury and referral pool
Transaction commitment with finality guarantee
```

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Match ends
- ✅ Result verified cryptographically
- ✅ Winnings instantly in vault
- ✅ NO wallet interaction
- ✅ Ready to play next game immediately

### 5. Withdrawal Flow

**User Journey:**
```
1. User clicks "Withdraw 3 SOL"
2. Choose 2FA (0.1% fee) or no 2FA (0.5% fee)
3. One wallet approval
4. Funds instantly in wallet
```

**Smart Contract Logic:**
```
Vault balance verification with atomic check
User 2FA status evaluation from account metadata
Tiered fee calculation based on security posture
    With 2FA: 0.1% fee (security incentive)
    Without 2FA: 0.5% fee (risk premium)
Net withdrawal amount computation
Atomic three-way transfer: vault → user + treasury
Vault balance state update with consistency
Transaction finality with success return
```

**Fee Structure:**
- With 2FA: 0.1% fee (secure)
- Without 2FA: 0.5% fee (incentivizes security)
- Fees go to treasury (platform sustainability)

## Infrastructure Fee Management

### Auto-Refill System

**Problem:** Users shouldn't worry about infrastructure fees

**Solution:** Automatic credit management

```
Infrastructure credit sufficiency check
Conditional error on insufficient funds
Atomic fee deduction from credit pool
Threshold evaluation for auto-refill trigger
Event emission for off-chain notification
Next deposit will trigger automatic top-up
Zero user interaction required
```

**Fee Breakdown:**
- Match creation: 0.0035 SOL (~1/3 of a penny)
- Match join: 0.0015 SOL (~1/6 of a penny)
- Initial credit: 0.02 SOL (covers ~6 games)
- Auto-refill: 0.03 SOL (covers ~9 games)

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Deposit once
- ✅ Infrastructure credit auto-managed
- ✅ Never runs out during gameplay
- ✅ Silently topped up from deposits

House Edge: 3% (lower than most casinos)
```

**Whale-Friendly:**
```
Max Wager: 10 SOL

## Technical Implementation

### PDA Structure

```
Account Fields:
- Owner authority (32 bytes) - Cryptographic wallet binding
- Gaming balance (8 bytes) - Available liquidity
- Infrastructure pool (8 bytes) - Pre-paid gas reserve
- Usage metrics (8 bytes) - Activity counter
- Creation timestamp (8 bytes) - Audit trail
- Cost recovery flag (1 byte) - Amortization state
- Bump seed (1 byte) - PDA derivation parameter

Total Account Size: 66 bytes (optimized for rent-exempt minimum)

Derivation: Deterministic seed-based PDA generation
```

### State Transitions

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Vault Created  │ (balance = 0, infrastructure = 0.02)
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         │ deposit(5 SOL)
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Vault Funded    │ (balance = 5, infrastructure = 0.02)
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         │ create_match(1 SOL)
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐

└─────────────────┘
```

## Security Considerations

### Vault Protection

**Access Control:**
```
Owner-only withdrawal enforcement
Cryptographic key comparison with vault authority
Platform verifier authorization check
Multi-signature validation for settlement
Role-based access control matrix
```

**Balance Validation:**
```
Pre-flight balance sufficiency checks
Atomic balance verification operations
Infrastructure credit threshold validation
Conditional error propagation on insufficient funds
```

**Reentrancy Protection:**
```
State-mutating operations ordered before external calls
Check-Effects-Interactions pattern enforcement
No cross-contract calls during state transition
Atomic state updates with rollback on failure
Prevents reentrancy attacks and race conditions
```

### Anti-Drain Measures

**Withdrawal Rate Limiting:**
- Max 1 withdrawal per minute (backend enforced)
- Suspicious patterns flagged
- Large withdrawals (>10 SOL) require 2FA

**Balance Reconciliation:**
- Backend tracks vault balance
- Daily audit against on-chain state
- Discrepancies investigated immediately
